>  Amidst geopolitical conflicts, the Middle Corridor is undergoing a crucial period of development. This is aligning with the EU’s plans to upgrade the corridor and reduce reliance on _Russian territory_ for trade with China. However, the Middle Corridor faces several challenges, including:




- 𝐋𝐨𝐰 𝐂𝐚𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐭𝐲: Only about 5% of the Northern Corridor’s capacity. 
    - Ports like Aktau, Baku, and Poti are at or near capacity
    - There’s a shortage of rolling stock in Georgia and Azerbaijan.
- 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: From established routes like the Northern Corridor (through Russia) and maritime routes. Competitive transit times and costs are crucial.
- 𝐏𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐖𝐢𝐥𝐥: Sustained cooperation among transit countries is vital, but political instability can impede progress.
- 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐕𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐥 𝐒𝐡𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞: Insufficient transport vessels on the Caspian Sea.
- 𝐄𝐱𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐝 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐬: Increased traffic has extended transport times to 40+ days, with long wait times at the Kazakhstan-Uzbekistan border.
- 𝐋𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐨𝐟 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲: Difficulty in calculating transport costs due to opaque price structure and currency risks.

## 𝐏𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐌𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬
- Address the Sivas-Kars-Georgia border railway bottleneck.
- Expand Poti’s maritime handling capacity and improve hinterland rail connectivity.
- Enhance railway infrastructure in Kazakhstan to boost transshipment capacity.
- Increase ship availability and capacity, particularly in the Caspian Sea.
- Enhance efficiency through initiatives like eTIR for better customs and border management
