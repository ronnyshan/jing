Today's society relies heavily on the continuous and reliable functioning of infrastructure systems such as telecommunications, electric power, gas and oil, water supply, and transportation. These systems are so essential that any interruption in their services can have crippling effects on citizens' well-being, the nation's economy, and society as a whole. Critical infrastructure is vulnerable to various threats, including natural hazards, component aging, increased demand, climate change, sabotage, and cascading failures due to their interdependencies.  In some cases, the network could recover from incidents, but if the critical infrastructure is under attack, a serious failure of the network may happen[^1].  


The sabotage of the railway is becoming more frequent. On July 26, 2024, just hours before the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympic Games, France's high-speed rail network was severely disrupted by coordinated acts of sabotage, including arson attacks. These incidents targeted the TGV lines connecting Paris to various regions and neighboring countries, causing widespread travel chaos. Fires were reported near the tracks on the Atlantique, Nord, and Est high-speed lines, particularly affecting Paris' major Montparnasse station. The attacks paralyzed several high-speed lines, leading to the cancellation and diversion of numerous trains. This disruption affected not only Olympic athletes and officials but also thousands of travelers, causing significant delays and cancellations. The incidents underscored the vulnerability of critical infrastructure and prompted a reevaluation of rail security policies. In 2023, sabotage targeted crucial communication cables, leading to widespread disruptions in rail services across northern Germany. The attacks caused severe delays and cancellations, affecting thousands of passengers and freight operations[^2].

However, Eurasian rail freight travels through multiple countries, there is lacking of intergovernmental mechanism to protect this intercontinental rail route. Eurasian rail transport is a critical component of the global supply chain, connecting vast regions from Europe to Asia. It has grown in significance, particularly after crises like the Red Sea shipping disruptions since Jan.2024, which have highlighted the vulnerabilities and strategic importance of alternative transport routes. However, this extensive intercontinental rail network faces several security challenges that could disrupt operations and threaten the safety of goods. The security concerns span a range of issues, including terrorist attacks, vandalism, and cyber threats. These risks not only pose immediate dangers but also have long-term impacts on  supply chain. Eurasian rail networks today face a variety of risks that can significantly disrupt operations:

- Terrorist Attacks: Terrorist groups view rail systems as high-profile targets due to their accessibility and the potential for mass casualties and economic disruption. For instance, the German-Poland border (Frankfurt (Oder)) and the Belarus-Poland border (Małaszewicze) are areas of concern. They are vulnerable to sabotage, with limited tracks and inadequate contingency plans in the short term. If sabotage were to occur at these two borders, the entire Eurasian railway network could be compromised.
-  Vandalism: Acts of vandalism, ranging from graffiti to the deliberate destruction of tracks and equipment, can cause substantial delays and repair costs. These activities are often politically motivated or carried out by disaffected individuals.
-  Cyber Threats: The increasing reliance on digital systems for rail operations has introduced vulnerabilities to cyberattacks or internet blackout. Hackers can target control systems, potentially causing derailments, schedule disruptions, and significant safety hazards. The internet blackout during the 2020 elections in Belarus significantly impacted the information transmission of the Eurasian rail freight. 

Several security measures could  be implemented across the Eurasian rail network to mitigate these risks:


- Surveillance Systems: Advanced CCTV and monitoring systems are in place at major rail hubs and along critical sections of the rail network. These systems help in the early detection of suspicious activities.
- Physical Security Enhancements: Barriers, fencing, and controlled access points have been established to protect rail infrastructure. Regular patrols and inspections are conducted to ensure the integrity of these physical security measures.
- Innovation in Technology: Investing in advanced technologies like AI-powered surveillance and blockchain for supply chain transparency can improve security.
- Intergovernmental Collaboration: Establishing international security frameworks and regular dialogues among the involved countries can foster better coordination and response strategies. However, the current Russia-Ukraine war will make this more challenging. 
- Cybersecurity Protocols: Robust cybersecurity frameworks have been developed to protect against digital threats. These include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular audits of IT infrastructure.
- Coordination and Response: Effective coordination between rail operators, law enforcement, and emergency services is crucial. Joint exercises and real-time information sharing help in maintaining a state of readiness.
- Legal framework across Borders: To protect the critical infrastructure, The European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP) includes the Council Directive 2008/114/EC, which focuses on identifying and improving the protection of critical infrastructures across Europe. In the USA, the Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD-7) establishes policies for critical infrastructure protection, identifying 17 sectors, each led by a federal Sector-Specific Agency to enhance protection and resilience.  Eurasian rail network that span multiple countries need harmonized security protocols. This requires international cooperation and standardization of security measures. 





##  Future Outlook

The coordinated sabotage of France's high-speed rail network during the Paris Olympic Games underscores the critical need for robust security measures for critical infrastructure . While significant challenges remain, ongoing technological advancements and international cooperation are essential to ensuring the safe and efficient operation of Eurasian rail transport. Policymakers and stakeholders must prioritize security to protect this critical infrastructure of the Eurasian rail transport. Implementing comprehensive security strategies that combine physical, digital, and procedural elements will be essential to ensuring the safe and efficient operation of Eurasian rail networks. Policymakers and stakeholders must prioritize security investments and foster international cooperation to address the dynamic nature of rail transport risks.
