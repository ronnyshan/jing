These systems are so essential that any interruption in their services can have crippling effects on citizens\u0026rsquo; well-being, the nation\u0026rsquo;s economy, and society as a whole. Critical infrastructure is vulnerable to various threats, including natural hazards, component aging, increased demand, climate change, sabotage, and cascading failures due to their interdependencies.","tags":["Resilience","Eurasian Rail Freight"],"title":"Rail attacks at Paris Olympics highlight security vulnerabilities in the Eurasian rail freight network","type":"post","url":"/2024/07/27/resilience/","weight":0,"wordcount":979},{"author":null,"categories":["Technology"],"content":"AI","date":1721732400,"description":"AI","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":"AI","excerpt_text":"AI","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":2900,"html":"AI","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721732400,"objectID":"d4ea5b78e1d4330a2e79b9bd79cf6e73","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2024/07/22/AI/","publishdate":"2024-07-23T11:00:00Z","readingtime":14,"relpermalink":"/2024/07/22/AI/","section":"post","summary":"Author: Warren B. Powell Professor Emeritus, Princeton University\nThere are now countless articles breathlessly talking about “AI,” the vast majority of which are talking about a very specific form of AI which is some form of machine learning (mostly pattern recognition) being performed using neural networks. This is hardly the only form of artificial intelligence, and it is far from even being the most advanced form. In addition, there are breathless articles of advanced intelligence which I claim are pure science fiction.","tags":["AI"],"title":"The seven levels of artificial intelligence","type":"post","url":"/2024/07/22/AI/","weight":0,"wordcount":2871},{"author":null,"categories":["Eurasia"],"content":"TITR","date":1721642400,"description":"TITR","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":"TITR","excerpt_text":"TITR","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":400,"html":"TITR","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721642400,"objectID":"90784f8bb4f2eca579bb1c3eb709ef4b","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2024/07/22/TITR/","publishdate":"2024-07-22T10:00:00Z","readingtime":2,"relpermalink":"/2024/07/22/TITR/","section":"post","summary":"The current Red Sea crisis poses significant disruptions to global supply chain resilience.
