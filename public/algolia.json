These systems are so essential that any interruption in their services can have crippling effects on citizens\u0026rsquo; well-being, the nation\u0026rsquo;s economy, and society as a whole. Critical infrastructure is vulnerable to various threats, including natural hazards, component aging, increased demand, climate change, sabotage, and cascading failures due to their interdependencies.","tags":["Resilience","Eurasian Rail Freight"],"title":"Rail attacks at Paris Olympics highlight security vulnerabilities in the Eurasian rail freight network","type":"post","url":"/2024/07/27/resilience/","weight":0,"wordcount":979},{"author":null,"categories":["Notes"],"content":"欧洲杯","date":1721905200,"description":"欧洲杯","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":"欧洲杯","excerpt_text":"欧洲杯","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":600,"html":"欧洲杯","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721905200,"objectID":"f62efed135cce58d75c25f6c8390b5ab","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2024/07/27/germanfootball/","publishdate":"2024-07-25T11:00:00Z","readingtime":2,"relpermalink":"/2024/07/27/germanfootball/","section":"post","summary":"欧洲杯1/4决赛后，德国的街道很安静。2006年德国世界杯和2010年南非世界杯，德国队都打入了1/4决赛。看着德国在2014年世界杯夺冠后","tags":["Germany"],"title":"欧洲杯1/4决赛，德国出局欧洲杯","type":"post","url":"/2024/07/27/germanfootball/","weight":0,"wordcount":541},{"author":null,"categories":["Technology"],"content":"AI","date":1721732400,"description":"AI","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":"AI","excerpt_text":"AI","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":2900,"html":"AI","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721732400,"objectID":"d4ea5b78e1d4330a2e79b9bd79cf6e73","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2024/07/22/AI/","publishdate":"2024-07-23T11:00:00Z","readingtime":14,"relpermalink":"/2024/07/22/AI/","section":"post","summary":"Author: Warren B. Powell Professor Emeritus, Princeton University\nThere are now countless articles breathlessly talking about “AI,” the vast majority of which are talking about a very specific form of AI which is some form of machine learning (mostly pattern recognition) being performed using neural networks. This is hardly the only form of artificial intelligence, and it is far from even being the most advanced form. In addition, there are breathless articles of advanced intelligence which I claim are pure science fiction.","tags":["AI"],"title":"The seven levels of artificial intelligence","type":"post","url":"/2024/07/22/AI/","weight":0,"wordcount":2871},{"author":null,"categories":["Eurasia"],"content":"TITR","date":1721642400,"description":"TITR","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":"TITR","excerpt_text":"TITR","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":400,"html":"TITR","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721642400,"objectID":"90784f8bb4f2eca579bb1c3eb709ef4b","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2024/07/22/TITR/","publishdate":"2024-07-22T10:00:00Z","readingtime":2,"relpermalink":"/2024/07/22/TITR/","section":"post","summary":"The current Red Sea crisis poses significant disruptions to global supply chain resilience.
