      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s society relies heavily on the continuous and reliable functioning of infrastructure systems such as telecommunications, electric power, gas and oil, water supply, and transportation. These systems are so essential that any interruption in their services can have crippling effects on citizens&amp;rsquo; well-being, the nation&amp;rsquo;s economy, and society as a whole. Critical infrastructure is vulnerable to various threats, including natural hazards, component aging, increased demand, climate change, sabotage, and cascading failures due to their interdependencies.</description>

      <description>Author: Warren B. Powell Professor Emeritus, Princeton University&#xA;There are now countless articles breathlessly talking about “AI,” the vast majority of which are talking about a very specific form of AI which is some form of machine learning (mostly pattern recognition) being performed using neural networks. This is hardly the only form of artificial intelligence, and it is far from even being the most advanced form. In addition, there are breathless articles of advanced intelligence which I claim are pure science fiction.</description>

      <description>The current Red Sea crisis poses significant disruptions to global supply chain resilience. In response, the Middle Corridor, also known as the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route (TITR), is gaining momentum.&#xA;This route integrates multimodal transport modes, including rail and sea, connecting Chinese and European markets via Central Asia and the South Caucasus1.&#xA;The current Red Sea crisis poses significant disruptions to global supply chain resilience.
